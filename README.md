# Magoosh_Fetch_Questions

Run this java script at Dashboard -> Practice Session ; to save all the questions along with answers screenshots at your browsers default downloads location with a single click.

Works for Custom Practice Sessions as well :) .

Note :- This is fairly for educational use only, sounds fancy :D ...... have fun xD, happy learning.


HOW TO USE?

THIS IS A EASIER AND FASTER WAY FOR BEGINNERS.

-> This is tested on chrome, so using chrome browser is recommended. Go to magoosh official website, Login...go to Dashboard -> Practice Session -> press F12 and navigate to the console tab -> copy the code from the Bodhith/Magoosh_Fetch_Questions/Script/main.js -> paste it and press enter -> sit back and enjoy, while the questions and their respective answers would taken screen shots and downloaded to the respective default downloads location for your browser.

THE OTHER WAY

I WOULDN'T BE IN MUCH DETAIL ABOUT IT THIS CAUS' IF YOU ARE READING TO FOLLOW THIS PROBABLY YOUR'E NOT A BEGINNER.

-> I'm sure there are lot of ways of doing this, and using an chrome extension for that I one of which and the extension for injecting the java script that we use now is called "Tampermonkey"...download and install it, or simply add it.

-> Create a new script with code from Bodhith/Magoosh_Fetch_Questions/Script/main.js

-> Enable the script and run it from Dashboard -> Practice Session or while in custom sessions.

ONCE DONE, IT'LL LOOK SOMETHING SIMILAR LIKE THIS

The file names would be redundant, let the screenshot png file name be "x" and the answer for that screenshot would be "x(1)"
